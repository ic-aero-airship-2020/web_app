      <h2>Voice Commands</h2>
      <p>
        To begin the speech recognition, click the button that says "Start listening". Then speak your command into your phone's microphone in a 
        clear voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a phrase has been recognised, the interpreted text will appear on the screen with a "Click to confirm" button below. If you wish to 
        send this command to the airship, click this button. If you wish to try again, click the button at the top of the page that says "Click to 
        retry".
      </p>
      <b>"Your browser doesn't support speech recognitions"</b>
      <p>
        To use the voice command features, please use Chrome.
      </p>
      <b>It's not listening to my voice</b>
      <p>
        You may need to manually give this page permission to use the microphone. You can find this in browser settings -> site settings -> microphone.
      </p>
      <b>It can't understand me</b>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the natural language processing technology used in this web app is still in it's infancy and therefore may struggle to interpret 
        commands.
      </p>

      <h2>Remote Control</h2>
      <p>
        The right joystick controls movement forwards and backwards, left and right. It may be helpful to think about it like you are controlling a 
        remote control car.
      </p>
      <p>
        The left joystick controls the airship height up and down, as well as yaw. Yaw means the airship will turn around on it's vertical axis. Compare it 
        to turning yourself to face someone next to you. This control can take some getting use to so if you are finding it difficult, focus on the right 
        joystick.
      </p>
      <b>It keeps saying to try again later</b>
      <p>
        The airship may only be controlled by one user at a time. On busy days this may mean that several visitors are trying to access this function. 
        Please keep refreshing the page to try again. In the future, we look to implement a queuing system, stay tuned!
      </p>

      <h2>Destination Request</h2>
      <P>
        The airship is capable of navigating to specific waypoints that are pre-saved before use by the ground station team. As the airship consinuously 
        localises itself using its regenerating map, it is able to navigate to these waypoints from any location. Please do ensure that you are close to 
        the airship when you use this function so that you may more easily follow it to your destination.
